Sticking with the basics, we have joy and fear.


## Joy ##
is how I feel
when I have what I want, or I don't want what I don't have.  I am
aligned with what *is*, and have no need or desire to change it.

## Fear ##
is the emotion which says I don't have enough information.  This is
usually about an unknown future.  I come to a proverbial fork in the
road and could simply choose arbitrarily, but if there is a part of me
that wants to choose the "*right*" option, I may feel fear about
choosing the "*wrong*" option.  This could paralyze me until I cannot
choose without more information about what each option entails.

Next, we have sadness.

## Sadness ##

is how I feel when I recognize I have lost(*) something.  I had it,
and now I don't have it.  I feel sad.  The message here is simply to
acknowledge the experience of having, whether it was an object, a pet,
or a fellow human.  This is what funerals are for: to acknowledge that
the person who was with us is no longer here (in the physical sense).
We take the chance to experience the loss in its fullness, allowing
acknowledgement of the new situation so we can move on.

## Anger ##

Anger is a slightly different emotion.  There are a few different
emotions that we lump together under one label.  Generally speaking,
anger is an emotion that comes up when boundaries have been crossed.
So-called righteous anger could be when personal space or personal
property has been encroached or taken.



(*)
Loss is something of a false belief in that I never *had* it in the
first place, but this line of inquiry goes beyond the basics outlined here.
